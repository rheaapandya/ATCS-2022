        Hi! My name is Rhea. I am 16 years old and I am a Junior. 
        I Have been travelling my whole life and thouroughly enjoy it. 
        When I am not at school you can find me hiking, walking my dog, and hanging out with my friends. 
        My favorite food is dehydrated Patagonia chilli.
